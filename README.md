2. If you already have an existing JSON file that you would like to navigate, enter 1. If you would like to use Twitter API to generate your file, enter 2.

3. If you have entered 1, the navigation will begin, if not, you will have two choices again:

After making the choice and choosing the Twitter account, the navigation will begin. 

4. If your file is a dictinary, you will see all available keys and be able to choose which to inspect. If it's a list, you will be informed about its length and get to choose the index of the element that you want to inspect. If the object you chose is a list or a dictinary, the process will repeat itself!

5. Note that you can go to the beggining of the program's work at any point, just input "-1"!
